# Cogito Ergo Sum

This is a platformer game that I made at the Counterspell Wolverhampton game jam.

It is made in Python with the PyGame library, pixel art was done in Piskel.

The theme of the jam was **you are your own enemy**, so in this game you are trying to escape clones of yourself.

There is a twist however to winning, play the game to find out what it is!

I didn't have time to finish off the final boss battle in the game jam, and I haven't added anything after to keep in the spirit of it, so it may be a bit underwhelming, sorry!

## Gameplay

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and space to jump.

The game-map is procedurally generated - you will have to work out how to win!
